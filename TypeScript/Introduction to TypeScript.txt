Type script:
I can be considered as a programming language
but it is a superset of JavaScript 
meaning that js code can be considered typescript but ts code is not js
It is basically JavaScript with additions or JavaScript+
JavaScipt is a loosely typed programming language meaning that we dont need specify the type of data we are using 
 but TypeScript is not because it adds types to JavaScript
Many companies prefer to use typeScript because it adds Type Safety to variables which improves the development experience
because by narrowing down type of data we are able to use better auto complete options and it also protects from 
many typs of errors
