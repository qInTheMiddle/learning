    // JSON means: Java Script Object Notation
    // JSON is a programming concept used in programming generally
    // JSON started with Javascript hence the name
    // JSON means: framework for holding a group of values that can be represented
    // in pairs that are key&value 
    // JSON: a method to represent information
    // programming and communication betwwen servers and clients and servers require
    // a lot of data transfer inwards and outwards. therefore there has to be a 
    // data carrier representing a common language between clients and servers, or
    // between systems generally, or between servers that exist in the world generally
    // and because Js objects is one of the representation that can represent this 
    // framework(JSON) that can be considered a data carrier, and because it has a 
    //  a simple yet easy and clear order. therefore it started in Js but its use
    // has widened a spread to include many communication operations like client and
    // server communication and building what is known as API
    // Most APIs use code written with the JSON method
    // Most mobile devices dont know how to deal with databases and only know how to 
    // deal with JSON. not with Javascript or Php but can deal with Json
    // weather swift, cotlyn, Java, Php, Python all programming at the moment can deal
    // with JSON therefore we can not simply say that JSON is just an object that can 
    // be used in Js because JSON is a much bigger cocept. It is also a specific 
    // representation data that is used for many purposes in programming generally
