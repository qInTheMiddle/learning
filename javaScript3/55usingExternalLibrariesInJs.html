    // using libraries of other programmers is a necessity 
    // one example is the calender library
    // libraries can have some of what you want ready but will never have exactley everyhting you
    // want so you will have to specify the library in order to alter what it can provide
    // to be suitable for you
    // Js libraries have documenation that helps the programmers to know how to modify
    // libraries and use them specifically for their needs
    // as an average 30% of code you be able to use libraries and 70% you will have
    // to write the code yourself the final project will be the result of putting the 
    // two pieces together
    // it nearly impossible to find everything you want in libraries so you must have
    // experience in: 1- using libraris  2- coding inorder to be bale to use these libraries
    // downloading them link them to your project and add the propertes you want to them
    
    // Two main sources for finding and downloading libraries:
    // 1- google: us ethe name of the library or the topic or the title you want the library
    // to be specialized in then write javascript to specify the language you want it in
    // 2- one of the biggest opensource source of libraries github 
    // in the search bar on the top left corner type name or topic or title
    // 2.1-when you get the results te first thing you must check for is the programming
    // language
    // 2.2 then you must check the number of stars it has to show if programmers like 
    // this library because it cause an indication on he capabilities of this library
    // and the amount of updats that happen in the library 
    // sometimes when there is many problems the developers have to address them and
    // fix them in updates so that you can benefit from th esolutions to the problems
    // with libraries that have less than a thousand users there using 
    // them is risky therefore the decision to use them is up to you (the programmer)
    // one good example of a good library is anime.js
    // It is important to read and understand the concepts and ideas documention 
    // provided in the front page when selecting any library. this is common in most 
    // libraries weather javascript or not 
    // there will also be a getting started section in the front page that will
    // include download and usage sections that will help you install the library 
    // and incorporate it your project 
    // you must know how to download the library and how to use it
    // understanding the library by looking at the code is very hard therefore 
    // documentation is very important to help you undrestand 
    // how it works and what the main functions are and how to use them
    // a package manager is helpful for downloading library in pls generaly
    // and it is the official way for downloading libraries that programmers are used
    // to 
    // one of the most famous package managers is npm
    // cdn is also another famous package manager that is the easiest to use and and 
    // only requires one download for the whole library that the teacher will be using 
    // it for the duration of the course
    // if the download section of the front page doesn't mention anything about 
    // downloading the cdn package manager then you can always look it up on google
    // cdnjs website is a good example of a website that provides cdn packages
    // the teacher used the example of downloading animejs 
    // cdn is a link that can take and include in the project as part of an outside 
    // script
    // many versions of the library will be available to choose from
    // the link is copied and usually pasted in the head section the teacher 
    // copied and pasted it after the title section and before the style section
    // obviously the link is not pasted directly but by using a src="" attribute in
    // the script tag 
    // after that it is as if all the code of the library animejs library are available
    // in the code
    // for usage part npm is different from cdn in that it requires importing and 
    // instalation but the cdn doesn't
    // if the link is copied and pasted in a webbrowser the result would be a large 
    // bulk of code grouped together that exists in a server somewhere
    // usually in the getting started section of the front there will be some lines
    // of code to help you understand for you to test like a function in the case of
    // animejs library this function is copied and pasted in the script section that
    // follows the body section to test bellow is a demonstration: 

    // anime({
    //     targets: 'div', 
    //     translateX: 250, 
    //     rotate: '1turn', 
    //     backgroundColor: '#FFF', 
    //     duration: 800
    // });

    // anime({
    //     targets: '#obj', 
    //     translateX: 250, 
    //     rotate: '1turn', 
        // backgroundColor: '#FFF', 
    //     duration: 800
    // });

    // the result of this will be the purple section of the screen moving animation
    // the parameters can be changed as well if the background is disable here the
    // animation can be seen more clearly
    // in the main page the documentation can be seen with many sections but for most
    // of the libraries the main source is their web site and usually a link will be 
    // provided in the front page next to the icon although there is documentation in
    // the repository section of the front page in github but the better ordered 
    // documaenation can be found in the libraries website if the library is well
    // known and has support
    // anime js has good explanation in the documentation part that shows the input 
    // and the result clearly

    // the teacher copied an attribute that wasnt available in github documantation
    // and available in the animejs library website website and the result was change
    // in the shape of the animation

    
    anime({
        targets: '#obj', 
        translateX: 250, 
        rotate: '1turn', 
        // backgroundColor: '#FFF', 
        borderRadius: ['0%', '50%'], 
        duration: 800
    });

    // the purpose of the lesson is not to teach about anime js but to teach about
    // libraries in general and familiarize the students with the use of libraries
    // the purpose is to be able to work seperately fro the teacher and be able to find 
    // the information on your own and this is achieved by visiting the documentation
    // part of libraries frequentky 
    // this is the general concept that needs to be understood in order to use external
    // libraries
