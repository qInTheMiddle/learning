    // one of the moast famous libraries in Js is jQuery and the idea behind it is 
    // that it lets you make js much easier by making the code simpler
    // because jQuery is a js library one should not be intimedated by  & it can be 
    // learned in half an hour
    // although jQuery is one of the most famous libraries in js its deminished
    // in the past few years due to the appearance of js frameworks like: viewjs, 
    // reactjs & angularjs
    // they cover much of the things that jQuery covers
    // but that doesnt mean that jQuery has become extinct it hasnt and is still
    // used to a large degree and it is important to become familiar with it
    // specifically because learning jQuery doesn't really take alot of time
    // if you write jQuery in google a link will be provided to the official website
    // a repository showing how jQuery was built can also be found because it is open
    // source
    // in the official website a brief explanation can be found along with download
    // link on the left corner 
    // because cdn package manager is the simplest option to add to your code and 
    // use the teacher went for latest release 3.x also he went for it because
    // it says slim minified which apparently means the easiest to use
    // above is the cdn link that was above the link is incorporated into script tag
    // after the title tag this is called importing the library
    // inodrer to make sure that the library has been imported properly you open the 
    // inspector in chrome and after selecting console there is a space where code can
    // be tested.the teacher then teste dthe $ to that is a function in jQuery and the
    // result showed a function thaht wqs conformation that the jQuery library has been
    // imported properly 
    // document.getElementById("text").innerHTML = "hello tttttt"

    // $("#text").html("welcome to ttt channel")
    // te result of this would be writing "welcome to ttt channel" in the html
    // notice how thw the code is much shorter bellow is another exmple:

    document.getElementById("text").addEventListener("click", function(){
        this.innerHTML = "hello tttt"
    })

    // $("#text").click(function(){
    //     $(this).html("welcome to ttttt channel")
    // })
    
    // the above jQuery code is identical to the code above it but uses less 
    // syntax

    // the next code does the same but with a double click instead of a click:

    // $("#text").on("dblclick", function(){
    //     $(this).html("welocme to tarmeez channel")
    // })

    // there are also many more events that you can use and benefit from 
    // the part that was covered here is a small part but it is the most
    // widely used in projects that use jQuery in general
