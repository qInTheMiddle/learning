    // A to do list with buttons was illustrated with a x or tick options for one button 
    // and another button for delete plus another one for editing the task infront of
    //  each task plus a button at the top for adding a new task
    // after editng the page and updating the page doesn't go back to the way it was 
    // originaly but rather stays the way it was last updated 
    // this is becaus eof using local storage to store my to do list final update 
    // giving us the last results
    // this si a new concept but all projects have new concepts that you will try for
    // first time one of which is storing your data in local storage
    // also we should not confine our selves to the apearance that is pressented by the 
    // teacher as long as we are implementing CRUD
    // after understanding the basics of CRUD then we can implement it in any manner 
    // we see fit we can also add as many features as we see fit
    // Next lesson we will be begenning the project and that will be all ladies and 
    // gentlemen
