    // The project will use many of the concepts that have already been covered
    // and some that haven't been covered
    // Project idea: it must rely on CRUD which means Create Read Update Delete
    // Create: the user must have the ability to create new things through the system
    // Read: the system must have the ability to present things to the user
    // Update: the user must have the ability to update things he has created
    // Delete: the user must be able to delete things he has craeted or updated 
    // one example of CRUD is a news website that the administrator has control
    // the client or administrator must be able to control the website without any 
    // programming experience
    // the admin must be able to create news with title and images
    // he must also ahve theh ability to view all the news that wa sposted in the past
    // he must also be able to update and change the details of the news
    // he must also be able to delete news
    // another example is blog websites. if you have your own blog websites that you 
    // write your own article in then it is similiar to news websites and you can crud it
    // a third and very famous example is (Todo list) this project is applied in many 
    // courses becase it is the clearest concept the applies CRUD
    // it is a website that stores the list of taskks you must do and the ones you finished
    // and the ones you haven't this operation relys heavily on CRUD by creating new 
    // tasks and having the ability to view the list of tasks and to have the ability 
    // to update tasks that have been completed and the tasks that haven't and you must 
    // the ability to delete the tasks that you wish to delete 
    // the final project we are gong to be working on is the todo list
    // it is not important to be creative, however it is important to use as many of
    // the concepts we learned in the course as possible and for it to be similiar
    // to realistic projects that exist instead of being similiar to simple projects
    // therefore if you create a calculator project you might benifit from improving
    // your programming logic because of the concepts this project uses, however it 
    // doesnt use CRUD. there are many other project ideas that are good for developing 
    // programming skills that could done later at a different time but as a graduation 
    // project the best choice is a todo list that uses CRUD
    // Even later i nmore advance courses the final project must always use CRUD
    // also Using CRUD doeant mean that the project properties must be confined in
    // the CRUD concept but rather that CRUD si the idea that the project is based on
    // but doesnt prevent from adding addtionanl features
    // As example you could add the ability create graphs representing you performance 
    // regarding the tasks such as the number of tasks you have implemeneted this month 
    // vs last month and weather an increase in your performance or not and other things
    // but the core concept remains CRUD and this is basicaly the idea of the final
    // project
    // Before starting the final project video series:
    // at the end of each video consider the next one a challenge
    // facing the challenge and then comparing the pruposed answer is less ideal than 
    // yours would really be helpful for development based on the experience of the 
    // teacher
    // also in general it is always better to try to be ahead of the teacher and try 
    // ideas before seeing the solution except for concepts that are completely new
    // concepts
    // an example of this would be after doing the (create) section you can try to 
    // do the update section ahead of the teacher te same goes for the delete section
    // of the project
    // if we get the solution completely wrong simply trying and failing to solve the 
    // problem would make us remember the solution ver well
    // so always try to be ahead of the teachr even if you are using references and many
    // other sources because it would help greatly
