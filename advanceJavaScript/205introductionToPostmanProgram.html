    // postman is a prgram that belongs to API clients catagory
    // it is used to unsderstand and test API
    // because understanding this process is very difficult we have to
    // such software to help us understand and we can't rely on simply 
    // using JavaScript
    // JSON place holder is one of the free APIs that we can use to
    // start learning about postman
    // after finaly installing postman:
    // collection on the left side is a group of requests
    // we craete a new collection and then we create a new request
    // for the url part we have to look in JSON placeholder website
    // we find in google
    // every API contains a collection of links that are called
    // end points
    // responses that have value in the 200s are usually correct
    // those that have values of 400 and above are usually incorrect
    // the provided link has an id that is called path parameter
    // endpoints have a format that is followed universally followed 
    // by most programmers that is called restful API
    // in this format the last number when removed we get everyhting related 
    // to the last word after the /
    // JSON placeholder provides docmentation that explains all we need 
    // to know about the end points
    // the JSON placeholder can be treated like a backend for todos and
    // we can aso use it as a back end for a social network that has 
    // posts hence the word post in the link
    // when we removed the number in the end the output was an array 
    // of objects instead of an object 
    // by removing the last number we were able to get a list of all the resources
    // in the guide part of the JSON placeholder website we can also 
    // findout how to create a resource
    // the link here is similiar to the one that provides the list of 
    // all resources but the request is different
    // instead of the default request GET we change it to POST
    // this website is a fake API that is open for everyone to learn therefore
    // we cannt create resource and all we get is a simulation that can
    // help users understand but if it were real we would have to add information
    // "title" and "body" this is done in the Prams section or tab that 
    // open by default
    // the documentation part tells us the parameneters we need to add
    // we click on the body tab or section then we select raw and
    // inside raw we select JSON then we add:
    // {
    //     "title": "ksdjfhkefhl",
    //     "body": "koifhloif"
    //     "userID": 2
    // }
    // this will create a new resource for us if it wa real but we 
    // already know that this is fake so there we go 
    // this is generally what APIs and requests are
