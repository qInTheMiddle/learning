    // API is avery broad subject and it covers many concepts
    // API is very important because 90% of projects in the real world 
    // nowadays use API
    // how websites work:
    // client (browser) sends a request to the server 
    // then th server retrieves the data from database
    // next database sends data to the server
    // after that the server generates html file using the data
    // then the server sends the html file to the clent (Browser)
    // finally the server sends html file (response) to client (Browser)
    // the technology that is used in the client(Browser) is called 
    // front end the the technology used in the server and database is
    // called backend
    // This is not the only way websites work but rather the general 
    // way
    // when the frontend code(html, css, js) and the backend code(php, mysql)
    // are included in the same project these websites are called connected 
    // websites
    // API is the same except for steps 4 and 5 
    // the server no longer generates html files but rather generates
    // statements and the API is an link between the server and client
    // (Browser) instead of step 5
    // API stands for Appilcation Programming Interface 
    // that helps interact with the server without knowing what is 
    // going inside the server واجهة التطبيق البرمجية 
    // API is a programming interface not a user interface
    // the server builds an api(data only) instead of generating html
    // and then sends API (Response) to client (Browser)
    // The final step is done in the browser 
    // the browser reads the API from the response then fills the UI
    // elements with the data it recieves
    // I'm guessing this is better because it lifts a huge load off the 
    // server
    // the client (Browser part is called frontend part 
    // frontend developes work on the client (Browser) part
    // the server and database are the backend that have backend developers
    // when using API the front end and back end have seperate project
    // html, css, js ar usd in a seperate project in the prontend and
    // the backend project will use somethig like php and MySql
    // this is what we mean when we say seperate websites المواقع المنفصلة 
    // because there wont be direct communication between frontend
    // and backend 
    // the ecommunication will be done throgh the API
    // companies that use API have two developer teams one for the 
    // frontend and the other for the backend 
    // and the API is a universaly undrstood language by all technologies
    // as a frontend developer the backend will be like a black box that
    // you know nothing about nor would you want to know anything 
    // about it and the API is the key to this black box
    // on the internet there are ready to use APIs for specific purposes
    // that can be used by the frontend developers
    // example: wether APIs, sports APIs, corona virus APIs, library
    // APIs, audio library APIs, photo library APIs ... etc
    // there are two API formats
    // JSON is one of them 
    // XML is the older less widely used format
