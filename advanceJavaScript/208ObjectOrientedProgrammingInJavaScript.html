    // the teacher noted that 1- this is not an object oriented programming 
    // course and that this concept is big and cannot be covered in a single 
    // lesson 
    // that being said this is merely an attempt to give us an impression 
    // or and idea about what object oriented programming is and the reason
    // why the ne key word was used
    // 2- although oop is a very important concept for programming in general
    // this concept is not used as much in Javascript, functional programming
    // is what is most commonly used in Javascript
    // Although we are not familiar with what fp means it is the programmibg
    // method we have been using in all the previous lessons so far up
    // to this point, we have been defining functions and deviding the 
    // code into functions
    // by dividing code into classes and using oop concepts like inheritance
    // we are moving towards oop, although that might it is important
    // to understand that oop is less commonly used than fp in javascript
    // not only that but also oop was not available in javascript before
    // and is vailabl in javascript es6 in way that gives an illusion that
    // it is oop but in reality and behind the scene what is actually used
    // is something called prototype was avaialable in Javascript and is 
    // used in a way that allows us to write code that is similliar to 
    // classes enabling js programmers to use oop
    // in conclusion oop is a concept that is rooted in js or in other
    // words js was not vreated with oop in mind
    // oop in js is 1- anything that uses JSON because it stands for
    // Java Script Object Notation the following is a json object:
    let x = {
        "name": "yarob",
        "age": 876
    }

    // console.log(typeof x)
    // oop means that different parts of the code are objects or beings
    // that have behaviours and properties
    // the behaviours and properties are grouped together as products
    // behaviours=functions and properties=vriables 
    // and grouped together=classes
    // the class then becomes a class or factory that can produce 
    // many thing.
    // it useless if it is not used to produce products
    // it is like aa bakery that cannot be eaten but can be used to produce
    // things we can eat
    // in oop we first buiold thge classes then the products that come out 
    // of the class
    // 2- classes:

    class Animal {

        // the following is implemented as soon as the class is assigned to a
        // a new variable
        constructor(customName, customColor){
            // console.log("new object")
            // this key word is used to refer to variables that are being 
            // assigned at the same exact moment and this concept is very
            // confusing for begginers 
            // a light bulb just turned on inside my head--
            // this is th object that is making assignment to it self
            this.name = customName
            this.color = customColor
        }

        move(){
            console.log("moving" + this.name)
        }

        jump(){
            console.log("jumping" + this.color)
        }
    }

    let lion = new Animal("lion", "brown")
    let tiger = new Animal("tiger", "orange")

    // console.log(lion.name)
    // let bird = new Animal()
    lion.move()
    lion.jump()

    tiger.move()

    // there are two types of objects in js class objects and json objects
    console.log(typeof tiger)
    // the prototype that json objects are using is the same oop is using
    // this lesson does not into the details of oop but merely glimpse
    // to try to have and how the oop parts of of the code work
